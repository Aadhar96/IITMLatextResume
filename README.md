IITMLatextResume
================

>Compact LaTeX Template for the standard institute format. This is a modification of MR Bharath's LaTeX template. I've made it more compact and added a small table option

##Available Commands

###\maketitle 
This makes the title, like in all LaTeX files, but thank to MR Bharath, who overloaded that function, it draws a fancy table sort of a thing to create a nice title that matches the institute standard resume format.

###\EducationTable
This is a an environment and must be inside the *\begin{}* and *\end{}* commands. 
> \begin{EducationTable} \\ \end{Educationtable}
